This demonstrates incorrect behaviour when using pyramid.threadlocal with
gunicorn and eventlet.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install and run this pyramid app with `pserve development.ini`
2. Connect to it with a web browser
3. While the first tab is loading, launch a second tab for the same URL
4. While they are both still loading, close the first tab

Observe: the requests returned by `get_current_request()` are mixed up with
respect to the requests passed into the view callable.
